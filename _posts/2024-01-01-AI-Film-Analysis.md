The day before the start of winter break was very calm and relaxing in the Full Stack Development pathway. What we did was watch the movie WALL-E and analyize how AI acts throughout the movie, their interaction with humans, and if we would potentially see AI being this way in the future with their current trajectory. 

## **AI in WALL-E**

Throughout the movie WALL-E, WALL-E is known as a small robot who has the purpose of collecting trash on Earth. WALL_E is also perceived as a curous and emotional robot. Over time, he starts to build an emotional relationship with the AI robot known as EVE.

The robot AUTO on the other hand is known as the more controlling robot who served the purpose of controlling the ship known as the Axiom and keep it away from Earth as it is slowly dying. AUTO also becomes defiant throughout the movie and disobeys the order of the captain of the ship so that they would stay away from Earth.

## **AI Ethics**

The movie does raise ethical concerns about hwo reliant humans became on AI for everything as time went by. This caused the hmans on the ship to get very fat and out of shape to the point where they could not stand up on their own. Also, the humans did not know what certain words meant and what used to happen on Earth such as agriculture. AUTO was heavily relied on for almost every task and this can cause the humans to be outdone by the AI. This is why it is important to have a balance in the amount that you use Ai for assistance as well as how much you do a task by yourself with no dependance on AI or machinery.

## **Human-AI Interaction**

The interaction between AI and humans throughout the show were both friendly and also ruthless and defiant. With the relationship EVE and WALL-E had with the humans, it was friendly and productive, the humans and AI in this case worked together to beat the bad AI and bring the ship back to Earth to try to save the planet. With the relationship between AUTO and the humans, AUto was tryign to stop the humans from beinging the ship back to Earth by any means possible, including in violent ways. This shows that the way that humans and Ai interact with each other all depends on the way that AI was programmed and what its purpose is.

## **AI's Role in Society**

In conclusion, the roles of Ai in society should be to aid humans in trying to accomplish tasks. Although, it should not be AI doing the majority of the work. AI should have the task of doing the difficukt and potentially dangerous parts of a job but it should be humans also involved in the task. If only AI did tasks for humans, we would end up lazy and out fo shape just like the humans in WALL-E. With the current path we are on with AI, it could potentially be a major aid with humans and be a blessing, or it couldbe a turn for the worst and end up being a curse that can harm the productivity of humans
