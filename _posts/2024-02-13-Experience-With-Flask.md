# My Experience With Flask

## **Intro: What Is Flask?**

Flask is a python framework that is used for the backend development of websites. It is often refered to as a microframework. Flask is known for how easy it is to use and how quick and efficient it is. Using Flask, you can also combine front end HTML & CSS with the backend framework to create a smoothly running application. 

### **What Makles Flask Different?**

Flask is different from HTML & CSS in the way that it is a web framework and not a markup language like HTML, or a styling language like CSS. Flask allows users to input data in the front end of the website, and their inputs get sent back to a database on the backend of the website. Flask allows you to handle different things such as form submissions, HTTPS requests and responses, and user sessions. Without the use of Flask, all of the data would stay on the front end of the website and not get sent to the back end database. 

### **Additional Technologues/Languages**

Even though Flask is a backend framework, it does work with other frameworks for better functionality:

* Jinja2: Jinja2 is used to show HTML content and create a frontend experience for the user fo the application. Jinja2 also allows the use of Python for much more functiionality of just regular HTML.

* Werkzeug: Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) that allows Flask to handle HTTPS request responses, manage page routing, and other functions.

* Flask-Login: Flask-Login allows flaks to authorize a useer before they are allowed to enter the application. For example, if the user was on an incognito tab trying to signin, the wesite would deny the user from using the website until they get on a secure account.

## **Resources**

Resources are they key to expanding your knowledge on Flask, and here are some that hacve helped me understand more:

* GeeksforGeeks: GeeksforGeeks is a very useful website that stores all you need to know about Flask, Python, and many other languiages you may need some insight on

* Stack Overflow: This is a platform that has many questions from other developers and all the answer you might need from other developers in the programming world.

## **Challenges & Learnings** 
When originally learning Flask, there were some confusing concepts I came across some issues. Some had to do with things such as routing, templates, and database integration. 

* Routing: When routing in a database, a problem you ca come across is not knowing how exactly to create a route. My solution was going to my avalible resources such as Stack Overflow and GeeksforGeeks in order for me to grasp the proper understanding for how to route. 

* Templates: A challenge that can come from trying to use templates is nto knowing the proper way to use an href link, since it is not the same as regular HTML templates. A sulution is looking at your Flask route name if you have one already, or turn to your resources avalible in order to learn how. 

## **Social Media Project:**

Using Flask, I have been able to start on multiple different projects such as a ToDo list, and now a social media application. So far I have been able to work on a landing page, home page, user registration, and user authentication. When I continue working on this social media application, I will work to implement the ability for users to post on this page.

With the use of Flask, it has made it a lot easier for me to connect the front end interface of the website and user inputs to the back end of the website, where the dataabse will store all of their data such as passwords, usernames, phone numbers, emails, and much more to come within the near future.
